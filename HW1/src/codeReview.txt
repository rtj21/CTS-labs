-mixed formatting rules (camelCase and snake_case) : formatting
-random spaces and indents (the calculate method just physically hurts my eyes to read :') ) : formatting
-comments that would otherwise be useless if we had proper variables : formatting
-unnecessary if/else blocks : formatting
-multiple variables that could be replaced by an enum : formatting

-some names are way too generic (setValue, temp, calculate,vb) : meaningful names
-lots of 'magic numbers' : meaningful names

-functions are not atomic (calculate does everything) / does not do one thing : functions
-functions are not short : functions

-the class has multiple responsibilities : SRS
-new functionalities would need to modify the code, not open closed : open closed principle

-generic exceptions : Do one thing
-WET functions (useless print functions) : DRY
